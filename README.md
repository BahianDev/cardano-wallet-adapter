# Cardano connect with wallet

This repository aims to provide useful hooks and a `<ConnectWithWallet>` React component to allow other React projects to use a Cardano wallet connector for wallets that support [CIP 8](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip8/) and [CIP 30](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/).
